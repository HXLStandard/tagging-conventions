    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      This document is part of the <a
      href="http://hxlstandard.org">Humanitarian Exchange Language</a>
      (HXL) version 1.1, a standard for increasing the efficiency and
      effectiveness of data exchange during humanitarian crises. This
      new version is fully backwards-compatible with data produced using
      HXL 1.0 (released 18 March 2016), and adds several new features,
      including JSON-based encodings and a standard way to refer to
      taxonomies/controlled vocabularies. There are also several new
      hashtags and attributes in the <a
      href="http://hxlstandard.org/standard/1_1final/dictionary/">hashtag
      dictionary</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intended audience for this specification is
      information-management professionals and software developers who
      require a formal definition of the HXL syntax. Most users who
      simply want to add hashtags to their data may prefer the <a
      href="http://hxlstandard.org/postcards/">HXL postcards</a> and the
      tutorial information at <a
      href="http://hxlstandard.org">hxlstandard.org</a>, as well as
      interactive HXL tool support under development at the <a
      href="https://tools.humdata.org">Humanitarian Data Exchange</a>
      (HDX).
    </p>
    <p>
      The HXL standard consists of two normative parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        HXL tagging conventions (this document) — instructions for
        adding HXL hashtags to spreadsheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
            href="http://hxlstandard.org/standard/1_1final/dictionary/">HXL
        hashtag dictionary</a> — a list of hashtags for
        identifying humanitarian data fields.

    </ol>
    <section id="design">
      <h4>1.1. Design philosophy</h4>
      <p>
        HXL is a lightweight standard by design. Most data standards
        dictate to users how they should collect and format their
        data; HXL, on the other hand, encourages organisations to add
        hashtags to their existing datasets, without requiring new
        skills or software tools, and interferes as little as possible
        in their current ways of working.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary focus of HXL is tabular-style data such as
        spreadsheets or API output from database tables, which
        represent the vast majority of the operational data collected
        in the humanitarian sphere; however, HXL hashtags can
        potentially have other applications, including labelling
        attributes for map layers or identifying data types in SMS
        messages.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="audience">
      <h3>1.2. Target audience</h3>
      <p>
        The standard's primary audiences are information-management
        specialists who are familiar with spreadsheets or relational
        databases, and computer programmers and database specialists
        looking to consume data produced by those
        information-management specialists.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="terms">
      <h3>1.3. Terms of use</h3>
      <p>
        HXL is available as an open standard — the working
        groups have designed it for use with humanitarian data, but
        people and organisations are welcome to use it for any purpose
        they choose. Note, however, that users may not claim support
        or endorsement from any members of the HXL working group or
        the organisations for which they work. The authors offer no
        warranty of any kind, so implementors use the standard at
        their own risk.

        The text of the standard itself is released into the public domain.

    <h2>2. Adding HXL hashtags to data</h2>
    <section id="tagging.spreadsheet">
      <h3>2.1 Spreadsheet Data eg. csv, xls, xlsx</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the following simple spreadsheet:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>LOCATION NAME</th>
            <th>LOCATION CODE</th>
            <th>NUMBER AFFECTED</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp A</td>
            <td>01000001</td>
            <td>2000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp B</td>
            <td>01000002</td>
            <td>750</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp C</td>
            <td>01000003</td>
            <td>1920</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Datasets like this — longer, of course, and with more
        columns — are the backbone of humanitarian information
        management, and they provide the input for most reports, maps,
        and visualisations coming out of a crisis. Unfortunately,
        creating those data products is time-consuming, and responders
        have to duplicate the work from crisis to crisis and even
        dataset to dataset, because it is hard to build reusable
        software tools that can understand the many different ways
        responders may choose to label their data. For example, the
        text header of the last column could have appeared in dozens
        of variants, and in several different languages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number affected</li>
        <li>Affected</li>
        <li>People affected</li>
        <li># de personnes concernées</li>
        <li>Afectadas/os</li>
        <li>عدد الأشخاص المتضررين</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Software tools need to be able to recognise that the figures
        in the third column refer to the number of people affected
        — regardless of how the data provider has decided to
        label it in the spreadsheet — so HXL adds a second
        header row containing short hashtags:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>LOCATION NAME</th>
            <th>LOCATION CODE</th>
            <th>NUMBER AFFECTED</th>
          </tr>
          <tr class="hxl">
            <td>#loc +name</td>
            <td>#loc +code</td>
            <td>#affected</td>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp A</td>
            <td>01000001</td>
            <td>2000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp B</td>
            <td>01000002</td>
            <td>750</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp C</td>
            <td>01000003</td>
            <td>1920</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Now, whether the text at the top of the column reads
        "Number affected" or "عدد الأشخاص المتضررين",
        software for cleaning, validating, analysing, mapping, or
        visualising the data can automatically recognise the hashtag
        #affected and use the figures below accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than one row of headers may appear above the HXL hashtag
        row — the hashtags themselves act as a marker to show
        automated systems where the headers end and the data begins:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th colspan="2">CAMP INFORMATION</th>
            <th>NEEDS</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>LOCATION NAME</th>
            <th>LOCATION CODE</th>
            <th>NUMBER AFFECTED</th>
          </tr>
          <tr class="hxl">
            <td>#loc +name</td>
            <td>#loc +code</td>
            <td>#affected</td>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp A</td>
            <td>01000001</td>
            <td>2000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp B</td>
            <td>01000002</td>
            <td>750</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Camp C</td>
            <td>01000003</td>
            <td>1920</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        HXL software should expect to find the hashtag row anywhere
        within the first 25 rows of a dataset and should assume that
        all rows below the hashtag row contain data.

      <h3>2.2 JSON data</h3>
      <p>
        It is becoming increasingly common for organisations to share
        data through APIs. HXL is well placed to add interoperability
        to that data through its support for JSON, the format
        most-commonly used by APIs. HXL is purposely restricted to a
        simplified subset of the full JSON specification. In this
        simplified subset, the data must be laid out in a
        non-hierarchical and tabular form. Two such forms are
        currently supported.
      </p>
      <section id="tagging.json.objects">
        <h4>2.2.1. Array of objects JSON style</h4>
        <p>
          This is a very common way for data to be presented where
          each row is a lookup between a hashtag key and a value:
        </p>
        <pre>[
        {
        "#hashtag": value,
        "#hashtag": value
        },
        {
        "#hashtag": value,
        "#hashtag": value
        }
        ]</pre>
        <p>
          An example of this is shown below:
        </p>
        <pre>[
        {
        "#event+id": 1,
        "#affected+killed": 1,
        "#region": "Mediterranean",
        "#meta+source+reliability": "Verified",
        "#date+reported": "05/11/2015",
        "#geo+lat": 36.891500,
        "#geo+lon": 27.287700
        },
        {
        "#event+id": 3,
        "#affected+killed": 1,
        "#region": "Central America incl. Mexico",
        "#meta+source+reliability": "Partially Verified",
        "#date+reported": "03/11/2015",
        "#geo+lat": 15.956400,
        "#geo+lon": -93.663100
        }
        ]</pre>
        <p>
          For repeated same named hashtags eg. to express multiple
          sectors using repeated #sector columns, the equivalent in
          this format is a comma separated list of sectors (see <a
          href="#special.repeating.list">4.1.1. The +list
          attribute</a>), e.g.
        </p>
        <pre>"#sector": "WASH,health"</pre>
        <p>
          Note that the array of objects form does not allow for
          human-readable headers. If there is a demand for these
          — and the array of arrays form outlined below does not
          suffice — then they will appear in a future version of
          the standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> HXL allows hashtag attributes to appear in any
          order, case-insensitive, with or without whitespace
          separating them, so these are all considered equivalent:
          "#affected+f+children", "#affected
          +children +f", and
          "#affected+Children+F". In JSON objects, it is
          essential that the property names be consistent, so you
          should take the following steps when converting a HXL
          hashtag specification (hashtag and attributes) for use as a
          JSON object property:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Convert to lowercase.</li>
          <li>Remove all whitespace.</li>
          <li>Present the attributes in US-ASCII alphabetical
          order.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Following these rules, the JSON property-name representation
          of the above HXL hashtag specification will always be
          "#affected+children+f".
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="tagging.json.arrays">
        <h4>2.2.2. Array of arrays JSON style</h4>
        <p>
          Although not widely used, this form is ideally suited to
          visualisations because it is significantly more compact than
          the Array of Objects format as the hashtags are only defined
          once in the first element of the Array:
        </p>
        <pre>[
        ["#hashtag", "#hashtag"],
        [value,value],
        [value,value]
        ]</pre>
        <p>
          Below is an example:
        </p>
        <pre>[
        ["#event+id","#affected+killed","#region","#meta+source+reliability", "#date+reported","#geo+lat","#geo+lon"],
        [1, 1, "Mediterranean", "Verified", "2015-11-05", 36.891500,27.287700],
        [3, 1, "Central America incl. Mexico", "Partially Verified", "2015-11-03", 15.956400, -93.663099]
        ]</pre>
        <p>
          If headers are needed, they can be added as an extra array prior to the hashtags.

    <h2>3. Structure of a HXL hashtag</h2>
    <p>
      The root of a HXL hashtag follows the same syntactic rules as a
      Twitter hashtag: it begins with the octothorpe/pound sign
      ("#") and contains only unaccented Roman alphabetic
      characters (so-called "ASCII letters,"
      "a" to "z"), Arabic numerals
      ("0" to "9"), and the underscore symbol
      ("_"). The first character must be alphabetic, and
      character case does not matter (#ADM1 and #adm1 are the same
      hashtag, though lowercase is preferred for stylistic
      reasons). Here are some examples of syntactically-valid HXL
      hashtags:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>#sector</li>
      <li>#org</li>
      <li>#households</li>
      <li>#impact</li>
    </ul>
    <section id="hashtags.attributes">
      <h3>3.1. Hashtag attributes</h3>
      <p>
        The core shared HXL hashtags describe high-level concepts like
        an organisation (#org), geographical coordinates (#geo), a
        humanitarian cluster or sector (#sector), the number of people
        affected (#affected), or a subdivision of a country
        (#adm1). Humanitarian datasets, however, often need to make
        finer-grained distinctions. For example, is an organisation
        the funder (donor) or the implementing agency? Does a column
        contain the name of an administrative subdivision or its code?
      </p>
      <p>
        HXL allows data providers to make these distinctions by attaching attributes to a hashtag.
      </p>
      <section id="hashtags.attributes.syntax">
        <h4>3.1.1. Attribute syntax</h4>
        <p>
          Attributes follow the same syntactic rules as hashtags,
          except that they begin with plus ("+") rather
          than the octothorpe/pound sign ("#"), and follow
          the hashtag , with optional whitespace separating the
          attributes. A hashtag may have any number of attributes, and
          order does not matter, so #org +funder +code has exactly the
          same meaning as #org +code +funder. The following examples
          show attributes attached to hashtags to refine their
          meaning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            #org +funder — the funding organisation (e.g. a donor)
          </li>
          <li>
            #org +funder +code — a machine-readable code (of
            some type) for a funding organisation
          </li>
          <li>
            #adm1 +name +i_fr — the name of an administrative
            level-one subdivision, in French
          </li>
          <li>
            #adm1 +code +v_pcode — the P-code (place code) of an
            administrative level-one subdivision (adding +v_pcode to
            +code to further refine the code type)
          </li>
          <li>
            #adm1 +code +v_iso3 — the ISO code of an
            administrative level-one subdivision (adding +v_iso3 to
            +code to further refine the code type)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Software processing HXL data may ignore any attributes it
          does not recognise and simply process the core hashtag. For
          more information on +v_ attributes, see <a
          href="#hashtags.attributes.vocab">3.1.4. Attributes for
          controlled vocabularies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> all attributes beginning with a single alphabetic
          character followed by an underscore (e.g. +v_ and +x_) are
          reserved for special use in HXL.

        <h4>3.1.2. Common attributes</h4>
        <p>
          Data providers may invent their own attributes to suit their
          local data needs; however, there are some recommended common
          attributes that will be useful across many data types. There
          is a full list in the HXL core tagset<sup><a
          href="#cmnt1">[a]</a></sup>, of which the following are some
          highlights:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          +displaced +idps +injured +reached +refugees
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Classifications for counts or descriptions of people,
          e.g. #affected +idps for the number of internally-displaced
          people.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          +code
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The value is a unique, machine-readable code,
          e.g. #adm1+code for an administrative level-one P-code.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          +f +m +i
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The value (usually a number) refers specifically to people
          of a specific gender (or +i for non-binary), e.g. +affected
          +f for the number of female people affected.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          +start +end
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The value refers to the beginning or end, e.g. #date+end for
          the end date of an activity.

        <h4>3.1.3. Attributes for languages</h4>
        <p>
          Humanitarian crises often take place in multicultural areas,
          where different local groups speak different languages;
          furthermore, international responders helping with a crisis
          may need to work in their own languages as well. As a
          result, humanitarian datasets are sometimes multilingual,
          listing the same information in e.g. French and Arabic, or
          Dari and Pashto.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make it easy to identify languages in HXL, the standard
          recommends that all two-character alphabetic attributes be
          reserved to represent ISO 639-1 language codes, such as
          +i_en for English. Data providers can use the attributes to
          mark the language of a column:
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>PROJECT TITLE</th>
              <th>TITRE DU PROJET</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="hxl">

          humanitarian datasets:

        <p>
          While the +code HXL attribute indicates that a value is a
          machine-readable code of some kind, it does not tell exactly
          what vocabulary, code list, or taxonomy is in use. Beginning
          with release 1.1, any HXL attribute beginning in +v_
          represents a short identifier for a controlled vocabulary,
          which you can look up (if desired) from a master HXL dataset
          at [url]<sup><a href="#cmnt2">[b]</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the HXL hashtag specification #country +code
          +v_iso3 indicates that the column contains country codes
          from the "v_iso3" vocabulary. To find more
          information about that vocabulary, software (or a human
          reader) may look it up in the master dataset, and find
          information like this:

      <h3>3.2. Creating extension hashtags</h3>
      <p>
        The HXL core hashtags include hashtags that will be generally
        applicable to many humanitarian datasets, but it is impossible
        to anticipate every hashtag for every humanitarian need. This
        standard makes the following four recommendations<sup><a
        href="#cmnt3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a
        href="#cmnt4">[d]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt5">[e]</a></sup>
        for extending HXL hashtags and attributes:
      </p>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>
          Whenever possible, take an existing hashtag with a broader
          meaning, and narrow it down with an attribute, e.g. #loc
          +hospital.
        </li>
        <li>
          When there is no applicable core hashtag, begin an extension
          hashtag with "x_", so that it will not conflict
          with any future HXL core hashtags, e.g. #x_toxicity.
        </li>
        <li>
          When software finds a HXL hashtag that it does not
          recognise, e.g. #x_toxicity, it should simply ignore the
          column of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          When software finds a HXL attribute that it does not
          recognise, e.g. #loc+hospital, it should ignore the
          attribute but still process the hashtag and any other
          attributes it does recognise: in this case, it should behave
          as if the dataset had contained simply #loc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> software designers may choose to warn about
        unrecognised hashtags and attributes, to help with error
        detection and quality control.

      <h1>4. Special cases</h1>
      <p>
        This section describes how to use HXL to deal with special
        cases that do not normally fit well into a tabular data model.
      </p>
      <section id="special.repeating">
        <h3>4.1. Repeating fields</h3>
        <p>
          A tabular format works poorly for repeated fields (e.g. an
          activity taking place in more than one location); however,
          using HXL hashtags, it is possible to design a spreadsheet
          format that allows for a fixed upper-limit of repetition.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the HXL hashtag for a generic geographical code
          (like a P-code) is #loc+code. A 3W spreadsheet for a
          specific country could allow room for up to three geocodes,
          like this:
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>P-CODE 1</th>
              <th>P-CODE 2</th>
              <th>P-CODE 3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="hxl">
              <td>#loc+code</td>
              <td>#loc+code</td>
              <td>#loc+code</td>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>020503</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>060107</td>
              <td>060108</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>173219</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>530012</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>530013</td>
              <td>530015</td>
              <td>279333</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          This approach is not currently possible with the <a
          href="#tagging.json.objects">Array of objects</a> JSON
          style, since any key may appear only once in a JSON
          object. Using the Array of arrays JSON encoding, the above
          example would look like this:
        </p>
        <pre>[
        ["P-CODE 1", "P-CODE 2", "P-CODE 3"],              
        ["#loc+code", "#loc+code", "#loc+code"],
        ["020503"],
        ["060107", "060108"],
        ["173219"],
        ["530013", "530015", "279333"]
        ]</pre>
        <p>
          By reading the HXL hashtag, processing software can easily
          recognize that the three columns represent (up to) three
          values for the same field, even though the full column
          titles differ, and even if the authors of the processing
          software knew nothing about the specific conventions in use
          in this country.
        </p>
        <section id="special.repeating.list">
          <h4>4.1.1. The +list attribute</h4>
          <p>
            New in version 1.1.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an alternative, HXL also supports the inclusion of
            multiple values in a single field, such as a spreadsheet
            cell, separated by a comma (or optionally, other
            punctuation). Note that this method—while popular with
            spreadsheet users—is not as reliable as using separate
            columns, and will not allow you to use standard spreadsheet
            functions for filtering and sorting while creating data. It
            may also not be as well-supported by HXL-aware tools, such
            as mapping and other visualisation services.
          </p>
          <p>
            To include multiple values in a single cell, add the +list
            attribute to the hashtag. Here is the earlier example recast
            with multiple values in a single cell:
          </p>
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>P-CODE</th>
              </tr>
              <tr class="hxl">
                <td>#loc +code +list</td>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>020503</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>060107, 060108</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>173219</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>530012</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>530013, 530015, 279333</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            This is the only approach currently possible for
            representing repeating fields using the Array of objects
            JSON style:
          </p>
          <pre>[
          {
          "#loc+code+list": "020503"
          },
          {
          "#loc+code+list": "060107,060108"
          },
          {
          "#loc+code+list": "173219"
          },
          {
          "#loc+code+list": "530012"
          },
          {
          "#loc+code+list": "530013,530015,279333"
          }
          ]</pre>
          <p>
            With the <a href="#tagging.json.arrays">Array of arrays</a>
            JSON style, the above example would look much like the
            spreadsheet table:
          </p>
          <pre>[
          ["#loc+code"],
          ["020503"],
          ["060107,060108"],
          ["173219"],
          ["530013,530015,279333"]
          ]</pre>
          <p>
            Note, again, that some HXL-aware software might not process
            this approach correctly, and that it can affect the display
            of reports, charts, and maps.

      <h2>Appendix C: Credits</h2>
      <p>
        HXL is a group effort of many people and organisations,
        including a wider community of over 100 members of the <a
        href="mailto:hxlproject@googlegroups.com">hxlproject@googlegroups.com</a>
        public mailing list. C.J. Hendrix (OCHA) was the founder of the
        HXL standards effort, and Carsten Keßler (Hunter College) was
        the original technical lead. Since 2013, Sarah Telford (OCHA)
        has been overall programme manager and David Megginson (OCHA)
        has served as standards lead and chair, while John Crowley
        helped with outreach and governance in late 2014 and early 2015,
        and Aidan McGuire (ScraperWiki) has provided project management
        since 2015. Generous funding for HXL research and development in
        2014 came from the Humanitarian Innovation Fund, and OCHA has
        supported continuing work. The Paul Allen Foundation has
        generously agreed to fund HXL work through 2016.
